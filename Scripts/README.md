# Scripts Folder

## Overview
The **Scripts** folder contains all the necessary scripts for data cleaning, model building, evaluation, and visualization. These scripts serve as the foundation for replicating the original analysis and conducting novel analysis in the **Diabetes Readmission Prediction** project. The folder also includes a Jupyter notebook that allows for interactive exploration and analysis.

## Files in this Directory

### `BigData.ipynb`
This collab notebook contains the core analysis for the project. It includes the following components:

- **Data Loading**: Loading the dataset and performing initial exploration of the data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and creating the target variable (`readmitted`).
- **Feature Engineering**: Generating additional features based on existing data to improve model performance.
- **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests to predict patient readmission.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the results of the model's performance using various plots (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve).

### How to Use the Scripts

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Make sure you have the required dependencies installed as specified in the `requirements.txt` (Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.).
   
2. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Open the `BigData.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab or google collab:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Run the notebook step-by-step, following the order of the code cells for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

3. **Interpret Results**:
   - Review the output in the notebook, including visualizations and model performance metrics. Modify the parameters of the models to fine-tune and improve predictions.
   
4. **Adapt the Code**:
   - The code is flexible and can be adapted to other datasets or projects with similar requirements. Update paths to data or model parameters as needed.

## Conclusion
The **Scripts** folder contains all necessary code for conducting the analysis and building the predictive model. By running the provided notebook, you can replicate the analysis, experiment with different models, and evaluate their performance. The scripts are modular and can be adapted for similar projects in predictive analytics.
