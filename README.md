# Diabetes-Readmission-Prediction

## Overview
The objective of this repository is to predict the likelihood of readmission within 30 days for diabetic patients using a dataset containing clinical records from 130 US hospitals. The dataset is used to build a predictive model that can help healthcare professionals forecast potential readmissions, enabling them to make timely interventions. This project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, building classification models, and evaluating their performance. It also includes clustering analysis to improve model prediction.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a classification model that predicts whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after discharge. The model is built using a dataset with 47 features and 101,766 instances. The repository includes code for data preprocessing, model building, clustering, and evaluating various machine learning models.
